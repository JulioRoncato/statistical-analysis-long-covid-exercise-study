# 📊 Statistical Analysis of Exercise Physiology Data in Long COVID

This repository documents the statistical consultancy and data analysis work performed for a peer-reviewed scientific study investigating the physiological effects of Long COVID during maximal exercise in young adults.

The project focuses on statistical modeling, data interpretation, and figure generation supporting the publication:

**“Long COVID Does Not Impair Hemodynamic, Vascular, or Autonomic Responses to Maximal Exercise: Sex-Stratified Study in Young Adults”**

## 🔬 Scientific Context

Long COVID has raised concerns regarding potential impairments in cardiovascular, vascular, and autonomic responses to physical exercise. This study evaluated whether young adults with a history of COVID-19 exhibit altered physiological responses during maximal exercise testing, with analyses stratified by biological sex.

## 👨‍💻 Role and Contributions

I acted as **statistical consultant and data analyst** for this study, with responsibilities including:

- Statistical analysis design and implementation  
- Execution of all statistical analyses  
- Support in interpretation of statistical results  
- Data curation and preparation for analysis  
- Generation of tables and publication-quality figures  

Although not listed as a co-author, all statistical analyses and visualizations presented in the article were performed by me.

## ⚙️ Statistical Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Preparation
- Data inspection and cleaning
- Variable transformation and normalization
- Grouping by sex and experimental condition

### 2️⃣ Statistical Analysis
Analyses were conducted using **R** and **GraphPad**, and included:

- Descriptive statistics
- Normality testing
- Group comparisons (parametric and non-parametric tests)
- Sex-stratified analyses
- Correlation analyses where applicable

### 3️⃣ Visualization
- Generation of publication-quality plots
- Clear representation of hemodynamic, vascular, and autonomic outcomes
- Stratified visual summaries by sex and condition

## 📊 Data Visualization

The figures in this repository are **representative reproductions** generated from simulated data to reflect the analytical workflow and graphical standards used in the published article.

All visualizations follow the same structure, statistical logic, and interpretation strategy applied in the original study.

---

## 🔐 Data Availability

Due to data ownership and confidentiality, the dataset provided in this repository is simulated. The scripts and analytical logic faithfully reproduce the statistical approach applied in the original publication.

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Software

- **R**
- **GraphPad Prism**
- ggplot2
- tidyverse
- base R statistical functions

---

## 📌 Key Takeaways

This project demonstrates:

- Applied statistical consulting in a peer-reviewed scientific study  
- Independent execution of complete statistical workflows  
- Interpretation of complex physiological data  
- Generation of publication-ready tables and figures  
- Reproducible and well-documented analytical pipelines
